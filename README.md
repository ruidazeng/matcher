# Piezoelectric Signature Matching Toolbox

This tool provides an interface for comparing impedance signature measurements to determine similarity for counterfeit detection.

# Background

The goal of this work is to identify a way to represent impedance signature data which is tolerant to some degree of noise while also uniquely identifying the measured specimen. 

# Run

To use matcher,

- clone this repository
- create and/or activate a python virtual environment (assumes python 3)
- run `pip install -e .` to run setup.py in develop mode
- run `python psig_match` to run `__main__.py` (cli wip)
